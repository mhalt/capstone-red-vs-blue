# Capstone Project: Red vs. Blue

For this project we were engaged in a black box penetration test. As part of the exercise we performed Red team activities including: reconnaissance, identification of vulnerabilities, attacks with different tools and scripts, and post exploitation tactics. For the Blue team portion we created a complete incident response summary and provided mitigation recommendations for the fictional organization.
